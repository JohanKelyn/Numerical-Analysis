# Solving Equations

Equation Solving is one of the most basic problems in scientific computing. This chapter introduces a number of iterative methods for locating solutions x of the equation f(x) = 0. 
In addition to introducing methods such as Bisection Method, Fixed-Point Iteration, and Newton's Method, we will analyze their rates of convergence. 

Topics Included:
 * Bisection Method
 * Fixed-Point Iteration
 * Newton-Raphson's Method
 * Modified Newton's Method
 * Secant Method
 * Method of False Position
