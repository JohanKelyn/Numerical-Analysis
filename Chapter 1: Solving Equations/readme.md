# Solving Equations

Equation Solving is one of the most basic problems in scientific computing. This chapter introduces a number of iterative methods for locating solutions x of the equation f(x) = 0. 
In addition to introducing methods such as Bisection Method, Fixed-Point Iteration, and Newton's Method, we will analyze their rates of convergence.
