# Least Squares

The concept of least squares dates from the pioneering work of Gauss and Legendre in the early 19th century. Its use permeates modern statistcis and mathematical modeling. The key techniques of regression and parameter estimation have become fundamental tools in the science and engineering.

In this chapter, the normal equations are introduced and applied to a variety of data fitting problems. More sophisticated approaches such as QR factorization and non-linear least squares will be introduced as well.
