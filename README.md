# Numerical-Analysis
Code for Numerical Analysis Methods in Python.

I decided to implement all the numerical methods that I learned in my numerical analysis class using Python.

All the code used in the book (numerical analysis second edition by Timothy Sauer) were for Matlab only.

This can be very useful for undergraduate students taking a numerical analysis class.

Each code has two to three example problems.

I am working on adding some comments to make the code easier to read.
